# AutoAnnotate

AutoAnnotate is an AI-driven project aimed at automating the process of annotating data for training Named Entity Recognition (NER) models. Instead of manually annotating entities in a text, AutoAnnotate takes raw data as input and generates JSON formatted data ready for training NER models. This project significantly streamlines the data preparation stage in NER model development, saving time and effort while improving the efficiency of the model training process.
