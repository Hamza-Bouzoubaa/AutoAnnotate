Illustrated vehicle design and highlighted major interior and exterior dimensions of the vehicle concept. Presented a technology plan on the above parameters.Simulation and Analysis of 1-2 Shift Processes of a 6-speed FWD AT, University of Michigan-Dearborn, March 2017.Established a mathematic model for the transmission-vehicle system consisting of general state variable equation, specific state variable equation for the 1st gear, 1-2 shift process and 2nd gear operation. Simulated the launch of the vehicle from rest in 1st gear, initiated 1-2 shift at a speed of 15 mph, and 2nd gear operation for 2 seconds with an open torque converter and a fixed throttle position using MATLAB/Simulink. Reduced torque overshoot by spark retarding, and careful calibration of the oncoming clutch. Further, torque hole was reduced to maximum extent with help of spark retard.Modelling of Vehicle cooling system, University of Michigan-Dearborn, November 2016.Built a Simulink model of vehicle cooling system consisting of four sub models namely, engine operation, air flowrate, coolant flowrate and heat transfer. Determined coolant flow rate, heat rejection from the engine, and engine outlet coolant temperature for different vehicle speeds by executing the simulation model.Computational Analysis of Hemispherical Radiating Fin, Visvesvaraya Technological University, April 2015.Derived heat transfer equations by using two-dimensional conduction equation in spherical coordinates and subjected the same to radiative boundary condition, with constant base temperature. Solved derived equations using Finite Difference Method and Gauss-Seidel iterations by writing a code in FORTRAN 95. Determined Heat transfer improvement as a function of thermal conductivity and emissivity, with and without irradiation. The hemispherical fin starts to radiate heat for thermal conductivity > 3 (W/mK) and absorbs heat for thermal conductivity < 3=\"\">Engineering Intern Jan 2016 to Jun 2016 Company NameCityCompleted basic and advanced level of training from regional training office of Maruti Suzuki India Limited.

Developed a solids transport model for predicting cuttings/cavings bed height during a hole-cleaning operation. In contrast to conventional CFD models that typically take several hours to run, this novel numerical model can obtain results within a few minutes, enabling timely optimization of the well circulation schedule. Investigated the competitive landscape and designed the commercialization plan for the numerical model. Leveraged the experiences from internal drilling experts and aligned with all stakeholders throughout the development processENGINEERING INTERN 05/2016 ï¼​ 08/2016 City , State Project: Optimize diverter pumping schedule for better production performance after well re-stimulation. Built a simulator to model proppant, diverter, and slurry distribution in a plug-and-perf hydraulic fracturing operation. Derived a simple proxy model to substitute time-consuming CFD-DEM simulations for predicting diverter transport through perforation clusters. Simulation time drops from 48+ hours to less than 1 sec. Provided recommendations for pumping schedule design in a fracturing treatmentPROCESS ENGINEER 04/2012 ï¼​ 05/2013 Company Name City Improve display yield through statistical modeling, process control, and tool modifications. Won Qualstar award in Nov. 2012 by completing two specific yield improvement tasks in merely two months, first time for QMT-TW to award its engineers after establishment. Optimized sealing process of interferometric modulator (iMoD) display that led to 52% pre-functional yield increase. Increased the up time of panel encapsulation station from 73% to 92% by leading two tool-modification projects involving a group of 5 equipment engineers and 2 external support engineers from JapanPROPPANT/DIVERTER TRANSPORT in HORIZONTAL WELLS, UT Austin Aug. 2014-present. Evaluate the efficiency of proppant/diverter transport in perforated horizontal wells under different slurry flow conditions using a combined CFD-DEM approach. Developed a multivariate statistical model to substitute traditional CFD model for predicting proppant transport through perforations at various flow conditions. The computational cost dropped 5 orders of magnitude. Accurately predicted DAS-measured proppant distribution in a field case with less than 10% errorChu-Hsiang Wu Page 2 DESIGN and SELECTION of GRAVEL PACK and SAND CONTROL SCREENS, UT Austin Jun. 2013-present. Develop analytical, DEM, and Monte Carlo models for predicting sand production through gravel packs and sand control screens. Accurately predicted 6 sand production lab-test results obtained from operators with less than 15% error using the developed model. Invented a DEM-based approach for extracting pore throat size distribution of complex packings. Results show that the pore throat sizes within gravel packs are usually between 1/5 to 1/9 of the effective gravel size. The findings correspond remarkably well with previous field observations and enable further optimization of gravel pack designs06/2010 Company Name Designed highly mixing-efficient serpentine channels for biomedical detection.
